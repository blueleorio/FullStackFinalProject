# ⭐️ Introduction

#### Hello, this is Sheeb. I made it for my final project in the Full Stack Developer course at CoderSchool. I use habit trackers every day and wanted to make one that is fun and helpful.

#### With Sheeb, you can keep track of your habits, stay excited, and enjoy reaching your goals. It's not just a habit tracker, it's a tool to help you get better every day.
